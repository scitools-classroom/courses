    "# An Introduction to Dask\n",
    "\n",

    "### General\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Thread\n",
    "A thread is the simplest unit of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process\n",
    "A process is an isolated computation which consists of one or more threads. The threads within a process can be executed concurrently (simultaneously) and have access to the same resources within the process (memory, executable code and variable values). Processes cannot share these resources with other processes. Each process has its own individual address space, while the threads within that process share their address space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph\n",
    "A way to represent 'things' and their relationships, where a node (circle) is a thing and an edge (line) between nodes is their relationship; e.g. a social network where nodes are people and edges are their friendships.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Dask architecture\n",
    "Below is the basic structure of how the components of dask interact:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/dask_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask uses a pool of workers to process tasks specified by the scheduler. The scheduler determines the tasks to be done by intelligently traversing the task graph. The task graph is produced dynamically and automatically passed to the scheduler when using dask functionality in your code. In the case of dask distributed, the task graph is submitted to the scheduler by the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scheduler\n",
    "One of Dask’s key benefits is its ability to efficiently schedule tasks to optimize computations. Everything Dask does is built on top of “schedulers”. These schedulers take the order of work established by a task graph and find the optimal way to break down and carry out the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask has four types of schedulers:\n",
    "- Synchronous: Single thread (good for debugging).\n",
    "        dask.get\n",
    "- Threaded: Utilises a thread pool.\n",
    "        dask.threaded.get\n",
    "- Multiprocessing: Utilises a process pool.\n",
    "        dask.multiprocessing.get\n",
    "- Distributed: Utilises a cluster of distributed machines.\n",
    "        distributed.Client.get\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Worker\n",
    "A worker receives tasks to process from the scheduler and returns output to the scheduler when that processing is finished. A worker can be a thread, a process or a whole machine, depending on the scheduler used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Client\n",
    "A client provides the primary point of access to a distributed scheduler and its associated workers. When using a threaded or multiprocessing scheduler interation with the scheduler is handled by the collection or delayed object.\n"
