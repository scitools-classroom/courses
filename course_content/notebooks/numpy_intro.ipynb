    "The Python language is an excellent tool for general-purpose programming, with a highly readable syntax, rich and powerful data types (strings, lists, sets, dictionaries, arbitrary length integers, etc) and a very comprehensive standard library. It was not, however, designed specifically for mathematical and scientific computing. Neither the language nor its standard library have facilities for the efficient representation of multidimensional datasets, tools for linear algebra and general matrix manipulations (essential building blocks of virtually all scientific computing).\n",

    "Note that all of this happens without ever actually creating the expanded arrays in memory! This broadcasting behavior is in practice enormously powerful, especially given that when NumPy broadcasts to create new dimensions or to 'stretch' existing ones, it doesn't actually duplicate the data. In the example above the operation is carried out as if the scalar 1.5 was a 1D array with 1.5 in all of its entries, but no actual array is ever created. This can save lots of memory in cases when the arrays in question are large. As such this can have significant performance implications."
